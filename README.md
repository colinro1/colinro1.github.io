I'm Colin and I'm from San Jose, CA. I am a mechanical engineering student at San Diego State University, graduating in Spring 2025. I really enjoy computer-aided design, especially in SolidWorks, Creo, and OnShape. I'm also interested learning about general engineering fundamentals, electro-mechanical instruments, and keeping up with modern technology.
